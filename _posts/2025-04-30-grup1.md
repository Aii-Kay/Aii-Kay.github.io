_Activity Selection Problem Example_

### What Is the Activity Selection Problem?
The Activity Selection Problem is a classic optimization challenge that deals with scheduling. Imagine you have a 
list of activities, each with a specific start time and finish time, and you want to participate in as many of 
them as possible. The catch is that you can only do one activity at a time. The goal is to select the maximum 
number of non-overlapping activities from the given list. This problem is a great example of how a simple, elegant 
strategy can lead to an optimal solution.


### Real-World Applications üìÖ
The Activity Selection Problem isn‚Äôt just some boring school exercise ‚Äî it actually pops up all over the place in real life. Anytime you‚Äôve got limited time and only one thing (or person) that can do the job at a time, this problem sneaks in.

Take office meeting rooms, for example. Say there's only one room, but a bunch of teams want to use it throughout the day. If you wanna squeeze in as many meetings as possible without stepping on each other‚Äôs toes, this greedy algorithm totally helps. It picks meetings that finish the fastest first, which means you free up the room quickly for the next one.

It‚Äôs the same story in factories ‚Äî like when you‚Äôve got just one machine and a bunch of tasks lined up. You can‚Äôt run them all at once, so choosing the tasks that end the soonest helps you keep that machine busy without wasting time.

Even in tech stuff, like CPU scheduling or conference planning, this trick comes in handy. Say you've got overlapping events at a big seminar ‚Äî you can use this strategy to pick talks that don‚Äôt crash into each other, so attendees can go to as many sessions as possible. Or when there‚Äôs limited bandwidth on a network, it helps you decide which stream to run next.

### The Algorithm Step-by-Step üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The algorithm is remarkably simple and efficient. Here's how it works:
1.  **Sort**: First, sort all the activities based on their **finish times** in ascending order.
2.  **Select**: Choose the very first activity in the sorted list. This is always your first optimal choice since it finishes the earliest.
3.  **Iterate**: Go through the rest of the sorted list. For each activity, check if its start time is on or after the finish time of the last activity you selected.
4.  **Add**: If there is no overlap, select this new activity and update it as the "last selected activity."
Continue this process until you have checked every activity.

### Solution Steps using a Greedy Algorithm
1. Sort the activities by their finish times in ascending order:
(1,4), (3,5), (0,6), (5,7), (8,9), (5,9)

2. Select the first activity that finishes the earliest: (1,4)

3. Select the next activity that starts after the previously selected activity finishes:
- Skip (3,5) because it starts before (1,4) finishes
- Skip (0,6) because it overlaps
- Select (5,7) because it starts after (1,4) finishes
- Select (8,9) because it starts after (5,7) finishes
- Skip (5,9) because it overlaps with (5,7)

### Final Result
The selected activities are:
(1,4), (5,7), and (8,9)

The maximum number of non-overlapping activities that can be done is 3.

### Why Does This Greedy Strategy Work?
The strategy of picking the activity that finishes earliest is proven to be optimal. By choosing it, you are not 
only making a safe, non-conflicting choice, but you are also maximizing the remaining time resource. Any other 
choice would involve an activity that finishes later, which could only reduce the amount of time available for 
other potential activities. This simple choice at each step intuitively leads to the best overall outcome.
