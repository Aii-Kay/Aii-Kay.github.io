### What’s Dijkstra’s Algorithm All About? 🚦

If you’ve ever wondered **how Google Maps finds the fastest route**, or how your internet decides the best path for sending data — chances are, **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** is doing the heavy lifting. This bad boy is a classic for finding the **shortest path** between nodes in a **weighted graph**, where each edge has a "cost" — like distance, time, or effort.

It was invented by **Edsger Dijkstra** back in the day (1956), but it’s still a go-to algorithm today in stuff like **routing, navigation, and game AI**. Unlike BFS, which just counts steps (edges), Dijkstra **adds up the weights** and gives you the **cheapest trip**, not just the fastest one in terms of hops.

### Core Vibe: Greedy but Smart 🧠💸

Dijkstra works using a **greedy approach**, meaning it always goes for the next best move it knows at that moment. It doesn’t look ahead — just trusts its gut and moves to the nearest unvisited node with the **lowest total cost** so far.

Sounds risky? Not really — because it **keeps updating** the cost of reaching all neighboring nodes. If it later finds a cheaper way to get somewhere, it updates the record.

### What You Need to Run Dijkstra in C++ 🛠️

Here’s what you’ll typically use in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;
```

Key structures:

* `vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph;` → Adjacency list for weighted edges
* `priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> pq;` → Min-heap to get the node with the shortest known distance
* `vector<int> dist(n, INF);` → To store the shortest distances
* `vector<bool> visited(n, false);` → To keep track of finalized nodes

---

### Step-by-Step: How Dijkstra Rolls 🎬

Here’s the high-level idea (and you’ll totally see how it maps to C++ code):

1. **Set up**: Distance from source to itself is `0`, others are `INF` (infinity).
2. **Put the source in the priority queue**.
3. While the queue isn’t empty:

   * Pop the node `u` with the smallest known distance.
   * If `u` is already visited, skip it.
   * For every neighbor `v` of `u`:

     * Calculate the cost from `source → u → v`.
     * If it’s cheaper than the current known cost to `v`, update it and push `v` into the queue.

### Full C++ Example 📘

```cpp
void dijkstra(int source, const vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& graph, vector<int>& dist) {
    const int INF = numeric_limits<int>::max();
    int n = graph.size();
    dist.assign(n, INF);
    dist[source] = 0;

    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> pq;
    pq.push({0, source});

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        int u = pq.top().second;
        int d = pq.top().first;
        pq.pop();

        if (d > dist[u]) continue;  // Already found a shorter path

        for (auto [v, weight] : graph[u]) {
            if (dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
                pq.push({dist[v], v});
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Tiny Example 🧮

Say we have:

* A (0) → B (1) with weight 1
* B (1) → C (2) with weight 2
* A (0) → C (2) with weight 5

Dijkstra starts at A:

* It sees B for 1, and C for 5.
* Then it visits B and sees a **better route to C**: 1 (to B) + 2 = **3**, which is better than 5.
* So it updates the shortest path to C as **3**.

And just like that — done.

### Dijkstra Can’t Handle Negative Drama ❌

Here’s a limitation you should know: **Dijkstra doesn’t do negative-weight edges**. Why? Because once it thinks it’s found the shortest path to a node, it won’t revisit it — so if a cheaper path shows up later thanks to a negative edge, it just ignores it. That’s a no-go.

If your graph has negative weights, switch to **Bellman-Ford**. It’s a bit slower but it handles all that drama like a pro.

### Where You’ll See Dijkstra in Real Life 🌍

Dijkstra’s Algorithm is basically **everywhere**:

* 🚗 **GPS & mapping**: Routes between two places? Yup.
* 🌐 **Network routing**: Finding the best path to send data packets
* 🎮 **Game AI**: NPCs finding paths in terrain
* 🏗️ **Logistics**: Optimizing delivery routes and costs

If something needs to **move smartly through a network**, Dijkstra’s probably under the hood making it happen.

### Wrap-Up: Dijkstra’s Still the G.O.A.T. 🏆

Despite being almost 70 years old, Dijkstra’s Algorithm is still holding it down in modern systems. It’s **simple, efficient, and powerful** — especially when coded right in a language like C++ that gives you full control over your data structures.
